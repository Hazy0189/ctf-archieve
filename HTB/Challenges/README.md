# HackTheBox Challenges

| Challenge | Category | Tag | Description | 
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| CRSid | pwn | `hard` `heap` `exit` `malloc consolidate` | use scanf by sending 0x400 bytes to move fastbin to small bin to be leak then change the name to address of the first chunk so we have 2 chunk point to the same place. after that do tcache poison to leak the key of exit and craft fake tls payload for exit |
| Dream Diary Chapter 2 | pwn | `hard` `heap` `poison null byte attack` `got` | overlaping the chunk by using poison nullbyte attack then change the pointer struct from binary to got to get shell |
| Dream Diary Chapter 3 | pwn | `hard` `heap` `off by one null byte` `unsafe unlink` `seccomp` | use unsafe unlink to overlap the chunk then we can do tcache poisoning __free_hook -> gadget where the rdi is our register and payload using sys_execveat |
| Math Door | pwn | `hard` `heap` `tcache poisoning` `restricted` `__free_hook` | since there is no view and fix size, we can use edit to make it point to other chunk header then we free to get unsorted bin where we can edit it to stdout to leak the address, after leaking the address use same technique to overwrite the __free_hook to get shell |
| No Return | pwn | `hard` `stack` `bof` `srop` `restricted` | use a gadget where it will put our input to stack and return to stack then do srop execve to get shell |
| Once and for all | pwn | `hard` `heap` `fastbin dup` `restricted` `unsorted bin attack` `off by one` | since tcache always full & the libc version is below 2.29 we can use fastbin dup and unsorted bin attack to get arb write then use stdin to get shell |
| Picture Magic | pwn | `hard` `heap` `house of einherjar` `restricted` `off by one null byte` `fmstr` | leak stack with fmstr then leak libc with create wrong size. since we cannot control the size and malloc only big size, we can use house of einherjar to make heap move to stack then overwrite the the stack ret to get shell |
| Zombiedote | pwn | `hard` `heap` `restricted` `exit` | since can only malloc once, use big size so that the heap enter to tls then leak the libc main_arena from tls. after that overwrite tls exit pointer and cookie also make fake tls dtor exit list to get shell |
